DESCRIPTION
===========

yajsync is a port of rsync (http://rsync.samba.org) written in
Java. It can either be used as a simple standalone rsync client or
server, or used for adding minimal rsync support to an application,
but please be aware that the API is unstable (and currently
undocumented) and will probably change a lot in the near future.

NOTE:

    yajsync currently supports a minimal subset of rsync protocol
    version 30.0, with the additional constraint that the peer must
    support rsync safe file lists.

Please also note:

   - recursive transfers always implies incremental recurse

   - use --charset for setting common character set (defaults to
     UTF-8). Note: --iconv is not supported.

   - client local file transfers always uses rsync's delta transfer
     algorithm, i.e. it does not work as 'rsync --whole-file'

   - checksum block lengths are not computed in the same way as rsync,
     checksum blocks are always a power of 2 and a minimum 512 bytes.

Extra feature:

    yajsync also adds the extra feature --defer-write (a local option
    only) which makes the receiver avoid writing into a temporary file
    if the target file is unchanged.

BUILDING
========

Build requirements:

    - git (http://git-scm.com)
    - ant (http://ant.apache.org)
    - OpenJDK (or Oracle JDK) Standard edition 1.7 or later
      (http://openjdk.java.net/ or http://java.oracle.com)

Build procedure:

    git clone <FIXME>
    cd <YAJSYNC_REPO_DIR>
    ant

USAGE
=====

(Windows) show client/server help (-h argument):

    java -jar build/jar/yajsync.jar  -h
    java -jar build/jar/yajsyncd.jar -h

(Unix/Linux, inject necessary umask information as a property,
assuming Bourne shell compatible syntax) show client/server help (-h
argument):

    java -Dumask=$(umask) -jar build/jar/yajsync.jar  -h
    java -Dumask=$(umask) -jar build/jar/yajsyncd.jar -h

(possibly provide the absolute path to build/jar/yajsync.jar and
build/jar/yajsyncd.jar respectively)

Recommended extra options to the jvm (turn on assertions, use a more
memory conservative garbage collector, turn on aggressive
optimisations):

    java -ea -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+AggressiveOpts -Dumask=$(umask) -jar build/jar/yajsyncd.jar -h
